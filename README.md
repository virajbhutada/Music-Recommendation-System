## Problem Statement
In today's digital age, despite the vast availability of music, users often struggle to find tracks that match their specific preferences, especially for activities like meditation and relaxation. This challenge stems from the sheer volume of choices and the subjective nature of individual tastes.

---

## Overview
The Music Recommendation System aims to solve this problem by providing personalized music recommendations tailored to each user's preferences. Users can input their preferences through dropdown selections and the system utilizes both user-provided data and automatically gathered information to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. This project leverages various data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve the recommendation process, ensuring that users discover music that resonates with their tastes and enhances their listening experience.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes related to Spotify tracks, including:

| Attribute             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| *user_id*           | A unique identifier for Spotify users, essential for tracking user-specific data and preferences. |
| *Track Name*        | The name of the track, allowing users to identify their preferred songs. |
| *Artist Name(s)*    | The name of the artist(s) associated with the track, providing additional context and aiding in artist-specific recommendations. |
| *Album Name*        | The name of the album to which the track belongs, useful for users who prefer album-based listening. |
| *Album Release Date*| The release date of the album, which can help in filtering tracks by release period. |
| *Track Number*      | The unique track number within the album, assisting in maintaining the order of tracks as they appear in the album. |
| *Track Duration (ms)*| The duration of the track in milliseconds, which can be useful for time-based filtering. |
| *Explicit*          | An indicator if the track contains explicit content, allowing for filtering based on content appropriateness. |
| *Popularity*        | A measure indicating how popular a track is based on its play count, aiding in recommending trending music. |
| *Added By*          | The user who added the track to a playlist, which can help in collaborative filtering. |
| *Added At*          | The timestamp when the track was added to the playlist, useful for tracking the timeline of user activity. |
| *Danceability*      | A metric describing how suitable a track is for dancing based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. |
| *Energy*            | A perceptual measure of intensity and activity in the track, helping to match tracks to user activity levels. |
| *Key*               | The key in which the track is performed. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation, useful for music theory-based recommendations. |
| *Loudness*          | The loudness of the track in decibels (dB), aiding in adjusting for volume preferences. |
| *Mode*              | Indicates the modality (major or minor) of the track, which can influence the emotional tone of the music. |
| *Speechiness*       | The presence of spoken words in the track, measured as the ratio of speech-like sounds to music-like sounds. |
| *Acousticness*      | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating whether the track is acoustic, useful for users who prefer acoustic music. |
| *Instrumentalness*  | Predicts whether a track contains vocals. Higher values suggest instrumental tracks, beneficial for background music. |
| *Liveness*          | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher values represent a higher probability of a live audience. |
| *Valence*           | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track, helping to match music to user mood. |
| *Tempo*             | Beats per minute (BPM) of the track, which can influence the energy and pace of the music. |
| *Time Signature*    | The estimated overall time signature of the track, useful for rhythm matching. |
